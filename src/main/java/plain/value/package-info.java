/**
 * It contains objects that represent a value. <br>
 * The objects in this package are intended to prevent programmers from re-assigning a value to a existing variable. <br>
 * Instead, they are supposed ask the object to change its content. <br>
 * From the object-oriented perspective, re-assigning a value is same as changing the identity of object. <br>
 * The identity of object should not be changed just like people should not change someone's identity.
